So this started as a way of getting a decent HyperspaceD6 Character Sheet into Owlbear Rodeo for player characters.

Then I had the idea of it handling NPC's as well.

And then I had the bright idea of an iniative/actions/round tracker.

Biting off more than I can chew, much?

i won't add a version number until such time as I've got the basics up and running, then I may hand it over to the SW Hyperspace D6 Discord crew to play with.

You never know, perhaps there is a coder there who can help!
